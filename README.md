#### Summary
Graphs are everywhere, especially in an increasingly interconnected world.

The idea is to use graph mining to analyze collaboration of actors in science fiction movies, where two actors are nodes connected by an edge if they both appeared in the same movie. For this, we applied a set of social network analysis techniques on a network of 200k actors and 20k sci-fi movies with Python, sklearn and NetworkX. We also applied NLP methods to analyze plot summaries, user reviews and the sentiment they express. To make things more acessible, the results of analysis are published on [an interactive website](https://polakowo.io/oscarobber/).

			<blockquote>
				<p>Explore IMDB dataset and user reviews to look behind the scenes of cinematography.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<h2><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" href="#dataset" id="dataset"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dataset</h2>
			<h3><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" href="#imdb" id="imdb"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>IMDB</h3>
			<p>To help serve users who want local access to their data, the IMDB offers their data set as plain text files that can be downloaded for free. The IMDb data comes as plain data files having <code>.list</code> extension. The files have been downloaded from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/interfaces">http://www.imdb.com/interfaces</a> using an FTP client, and include compressed archives created by assembling collections of plain text files of <code>.list</code> format. The fetched data includes 52 archives and 4 folders. The size is estimated by <span class="Number">12.63GB</span>. The files downloaded have a format that is not easily readable by most computational tools learned in the course, therefore the data preparation played a major role in this project, and required a lot of effort. Since files from <a href="ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/misc/movies/database/">ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/misc/movies/database/</a> contain somewhat different numbers of columns and rows, and furthermore include different headers, the files had to be translated into a SQL database using a third-party service <a href="http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net">http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net</a>. But because SQL do not offers infrastructure required to easily access various attributes (and many other downsides, see Explainer Notebook), we have built an infrastructure to transfer the most important data to a NoSQL database. Properties of the resulting database are listed below.</p>
			<h3><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" href="#user-reviews" id="user-reviews"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>User reviews</h3>
			<p>For text analysis we used the <em>Large Movie Review Dataset v1.0</em> fetched from <a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/%7Eamaas/data/sentiment/">http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/</a>. The core dataset contains <span class="Number">50,000</span> labeled, as well as unlabeled documents for unsupervised learning. In the entire collection, no more than 30 reviews are allowed for any given movie because reviews for the same movie tend to have correlated ratings. We used unlabeled data, as we are not interested in already provided sentiments, but want to calculate sentiments on ourselves. User reviews are keyed by IMDB ids rather than primary keys in the SQL database, hence we need to map each IMDB id to the corresponding primary key to be able to compare sentiments with other attributes like gross, release year, and more. As there is no information on IMDB ids in the database itself, we parsed OMDB website to find those.</p>
			<h3><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" href="#omdb" id="omdb"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>OMDB</h3>
			<p>The OMDb API is a free web service to obtain movie information. We have obtained <span class="Number">60,000</span> JSON documents from <a href="https://www.omdbapi.com">https://www.omdbapi.com</a>. Each JSON document contains following fields.</p>

			<h4>Movie-to-movie network</h4>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Bipartite network projection is an extensively used method for compressing information about bipartite networks (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_network_projection">read here</a>). For the convenience of directly showing the relation structure among a particular set of nodes, bipartite networks are usually compressed by one-mode projection. This means that the ensuing network contains nodes of only either of the two sets, and two <strong>M</strong> (or, alternatively, <strong>A</strong>) nodes are connected only if when they have at least one common neighboring <strong>A</strong> (or, alternatively, <strong>M</strong>) node.</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p><span class="Number">172,650</span> actors played in <span class="Number">13,989</span> movies.</p>
			<p>The biggest cast has movie <strong>Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie (2014)</strong> with <span class="Number">448</span> actors. Here, IMDB lists all the normally uncredited extras in the cast.</p>
			<p><img class="imgTight" alt="Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie (2014)" src="images/angry.jpg"></p>
			<p>Actor <strong>Kōichi Yamadera (1961)</strong> played in <span class="Number">48</span> science fiction films.</p>
			<p><img class="imgTight" alt="Kōichi Yamadera (1961)" src="images/Yamadera.png"></p>
			<p>An actor acts in only <span class="Number">1.2</span> movies on average, and vice versa.</p>
			<p><span class="Number">82%</span> of movies and actors are connected, meaning if you get friends with an well-known actor, through a chain of actor-to-actor relationships you may become friends with <span class="Number">82%</span> of all actors on the planet.</p>
			<p>Probability that a particular actor plays in a particular movie is <span class="Number">0.0014%</span></p>
			<p>Probability that an actor plays in two random movies is <span class="Number">0.13%</span></p>
			<p>Probability that a movie hires two random actors is <span class="Number">0.034%</span></p>
			<p>An actor knows <span class="Number">59</span> actors on average.</p>
			<p><strong>Stan Lee (1922)</strong> knows <span class="Number">3,052</span> actors in total.</p>
			<p><img class="imgTight" alt="Stan Lee (1922)" src="images/stanlee.jpg"></p>
			<p>A movie is connected through an actor to <span class="Number">18</span> movies on average.</p>
			<p>Two random actors (or movies) are reached in a maximum of <span class="Number">14</span> steps.</p>
			<p>Degrees of co-stardom network follow the power law distribution, meaning the most common number of movies an actor plays is <span class="Number">1</span>, while the most common number of actors a movie hires is <span class="Number">2</span></p>

			<p>Friendship paradox is true: the most actors know fewer actors than those know on average.</p>
			<h3><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" href="#centrality" id="centrality"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Centrality</h3>
			<blockquote>
				<p>In graph theory and network analysis, indicators of centrality identify the most important vertices within a graph</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>We are going to explore the most central nodes according to a few different centrality definitions.</p>
			<h4>Betweenness and closeness centrality</h4>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Betweenness centrality quantifies the number of times a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path between two other nodes. Closeness centrality measures the mean distance from a node to other nodes.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>If you want to get friends with the most actors on Earth, first become friends with the cast of <strong>Iron Man Three (2013)</strong>, <strong>Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011)</strong>, or <strong>Captain America: Civil War (2016)</strong> as they are the most central hubs in the co-stardom network of science fiction movies.</p>
			<p>
				<img class="imgTight" alt="Iron Man Three (2013)" src="images/ironman3.jpg">
				<img class="imgTight" alt="Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011)" src="images/transformers.jpg">
				<img class="imgTight" alt="Captain America: Civil War (2016)" src="images/captainamerica.jpg">
			</p>
			<h4>Degree centrality</h4>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Degree centrality is the most basic method of defining centrality, basing the centrality only on the number of neighbours a node has.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Actors who played in <strong>Kaze no tani no Naushika (1984)</strong> played also in <span class="Number">343</span> different movies, which is a record.</p>
			<p><img class="imgTight" alt="Kaze no tani no Naushika (1984)" src="images/kaze.jpg"></p>
			<h4>Eigenvector centrality</h4>
			<blockquote>
				<p>The eigenvector centrality thesis reads: A node is important if it is linked to by other important nodes.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Actors who played in <strong>Kidô senshi Gandamu (1981)</strong> played also in very connected movies like <strong>Kaze no tani no Naushika (1984)</strong></p>
			<p><img class="imgTight" alt="Kidô senshi Gandamu (1981)" src="images/gundam.jpg"></p>
			<h3><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" href="#attributes" id="attributes"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Attributes</h3>
			<p>Now we move on to observe different attributes (those of movies as well as those of actors). This step of analysis helps us to uncover the real structure of the network and how it has grown. We will check the assortativity of nodes in respect to attributes, but also answer whether attributes build good communities across the network.</p>
			<p>The science fiction genre has experienced the main gain in popularity in the beginning of <span class="Number">2000th</span>, when the technology for movie production evolutionized, and it goes through the peak right now.</p>
			<p><iframe height="300px" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plot.ly/~polakowo/4.embed"></iframe></p>
			<p>The most common runtimes are around <span class="Number">10-30</span> min and <span class="Number">80-120</span> min.</p>
			<p><iframe height="300px" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plot.ly/~polakowo/6.embed"></iframe></p>
			<p>The most movies are low-budget movies. The more budget the movie has, the more money it spends on cast and crew, and the more profitable actors it hires, which also play in many other pictures.</p>
			<p><iframe height="300px" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plot.ly/~polakowo/10.embed"></iframe></p>
			<p>There more a movie invests, the more it becomes in return.</p>
			<p><iframe height="300px" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plot.ly/~polakowo/14.embed"></iframe></p>
			<p>The most actors of sci-fi films were born from <span class="Number">1950</span> to <span class="Number">1980</span>. Actors who were born in later years are younger and therefore less wanted as more experienced actors. We also see a trend that the science fiction becomes more and more popular and many new actors join this trend.</p>
			<p><iframe height="300px" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plot.ly/~polakowo/16.embed"></iframe></p>
			<p>Height attribute, in contrast, follows the normal (Gaussian) distribution, and isn't correlated with any other attribute.</p>
			<p><iframe height="300px" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plot.ly/~polakowo/18.embed"></iframe></p>
			<h3><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" href="#assortativity" id="assortativity"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Assortativity</h3>
			<blockquote>
			<p>Assortative mixing is a preference for a network's nodes to attach to others that are similar in some way. The more is the coefficient of assortativity towards an attribute, the more the nodes prefer to attach to other nodes having a similar attribute value.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>By knowing assortativity we can closely approximate the behavior of the network.</p>

We discovered a correlation between maximal value on the scale and the performance: if some values go above ~1000, the algorithm hangs, hence some attributes have been rescaled to [1,10]. The modularity hasn't suffered.</em></p>
			<p>Production countries, release years, and languages are not good communities, that is for example, movies made within USA are interconnected only moderately, while they share many connections with movies made outside of USA. Film industry is an international industry.</p>

			<p>None of the actor-related attributes build good communities, in particular, for attribute birth place it means that actors act with international actors very commonly, while for attribute birth year it means that teens commonly play with adults, and vice versa.</p>
			<p>Next we will illustrate the modularity of the attribute <strong>birth place</strong> by drawing Danish actors and their co-actors.</p>
			<p><img alt="Sample of network of danish actors" src="images/A_com.png"></p>
			<p>We see that only a few Danes acted with other Danes together. Hence, birth places fail to represent communities in actor-to-actor network.</p>
			<h4>Modularity of best partition</h4>
			<p>This is the partition of highest modularity, i.e. the highest partition of the dendrogram generated by the Louvain algorithm.</p>

			<p>The communities detected by an algorithm are much better than those of attributes.</p>
			<p>Let us get a feel of newly calculated modularity by drawing a random graph.</p>
			<p><img alt="Best partition by Louvain algorithm" src="images/louvain_com.png"></p>
			<p>Each coloured node (and edge) belong to community 0, and their colour depends upon degree. All grey-coloured nodes (and edges) belong to other communities. We can discover the almost perfect partition. We recognize it by the cardinality of links within nodes of the same community (strong boundaries of coloured sections) being higher than the cardinality of links to other communities.</p>

			<p>Now we are going to dig a little deeper into contents of movies to answer whether there is a correlation between keywords provided by IMDB and plots, and whether actors tend to act in movies of the same contents.</p>
			<h3><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" href="#keywords" id="keywords"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Keywords</h3>
			<p>First of all we will discover keywords provided by IMDB.</p>
			<h4>Most common</h4>
			<p><img alt="The most common keywords" src="images/mckwds.png"></p>
			<p>The most common term is <em>independent-film</em>, a feature film that is produced mostly or completely outside of the major film studio system.</p>
			<p>Films based on a novel enjoy the popularity.</p>
			<h4>By genre</h4>
			<p><img alt="Most common keywords by genre" src="images/kwdsbygenre.png"></p>
			<p>More general terms <em>murder</em>, <em>female-nudity</em>, <em>sex</em> and <em>death</em> describe what the most films are about: murders and sex.</p>
			<p>Keywords provided by IMDB highly correlate with contents of entire genres. The most common words of science fiction are <em>alien</em>, <em>outer-space</em>, <em>monster</em>, and <em>robot</em>. Horror films can be mainly described by terms <em>murder</em>, <em>death</em>, and <em>blood</em>. Terms <em>murder</em> and <em>police</em> are on the top of crime genre. The term <em>murder</em> is also very frequent in dramas. War films commonly show <em>WWII</em> and <em>nazis</em>.</p>
			<h4>Top 250 movies</h4>
			<p><img alt="Keywords of top 250" src="images/kwdstop250.png"></p>
			<p>The most profitable movies are biased towards particular terms.</p>
			<p><em>Explosion</em> is one of the most frequent words for the most expensive movies. The more a production company has money, the more it invests in special effects, and the more explosions it shows. Across top 250 films by gross the most promising are blockbusters. Box-office-hit keyword (describing a highly-grossing picture) is also the most common in top 250 films by budget. All those keywords are less common for movies with the highest IMDB ratings though, where the independent-film and mockumentary (parody) top the list.</p>
			<p>The most successful and top-rated films seem to differ a lot, they even mirror opposite trends: almost none of the keyword <em>independent-film</em> are present in the keywords set of the most expensive and profitable movies. On the other side, none of the term <em>box-office-hit</em> are in top-rated films. The same observation we do wenn we look at word <em>love</em>. Quite a lot of top-rated movies are about love, but only a bunch of most successful films are (which are mainly blockbusters with breathtaking explosions), that is, the top-rated films interact with feelings of watchers and trigger sympathy.</p>
			<h4>Similarity</h4>
			<iframe height="300px" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://plot.ly/~polakowo/20.embed"></iframe>
			<p>The most movies - <span class="Number">73%</span> - aren't similar regarding keywords, meaning that keywords are maybe to concrete for a similarity measure. But, having seen those keywords anywhere, you will be able to identify the movie right away.</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Assortativity</th>
						<th>Attribute</th>
						<th>Coefficient</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>Numeric</td>
						<td>Average similarity</td>
						<td>0.50</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>The actors tend to play in movies described by similar keywords (moderately though).</p>
			<p>There is no single attribute correlated with similarity. Willing to act in movies of similar content depends on a dicision of an actor rather than on a movie. This decision isn't depending upon year, nor it is depending upon gross, budget and other measures: it is an output of complex psychology of an actor.</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>Explore IMDB dataset and user reviews to look behind the scenes of cinematography.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>This is a synergy project of <em>Computational Tools for Big Data</em> and <em>Social Graphs and Interactions</em>. We aim at combining knowledge from both courses to make a comprehensive analysis on co-stardom network of movies and actors (and draw some beautiful plots). We will use knowledge on network analysis and perform it highly efficiently using big data concepts learned in the Big Data course.</p>
			<hr>
			
			<h2><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" href="#dataset" id="dataset"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dataset</h2>
			<h3><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" href="#imdb" id="imdb"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>IMDB</h3>
			<p>To help serve users who want local access to their data, the IMDB offers their data set as plain text files that can be downloaded for free. The IMDb data comes as plain data files having <code>.list</code> extension. The files have been downloaded from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/interfaces">http://www.imdb.com/interfaces</a> using an FTP client, and include compressed archives created by assembling collections of plain text files of <code>.list</code> format. The fetched data includes 52 archives and 4 folders. The size is estimated by <span class="Number">12.63GB</span>. The files downloaded have a format that is not easily readable by most computational tools learned in the course, therefore the data preparation played a major role in this project, and required a lot of effort. Since files from <a href="ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/misc/movies/database/">ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/misc/movies/database/</a> contain somewhat different numbers of columns and rows, and furthermore include different headers, the files had to be translated into a SQL database using a third-party service <a href="http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net">http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net</a>. But because SQL do not offers infrastructure required to easily access various attributes (and many other downsides, see Explainer Notebook), we have built an infrastructure to transfer the most important data to a NoSQL database. Properties of the resulting database are listed below.</p>
			
			<h3><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" href="#user-reviews" id="user-reviews"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>User reviews</h3>
			<p>For text analysis we used the <em>Large Movie Review Dataset v1.0</em> fetched from <a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/%7Eamaas/data/sentiment/">http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/</a>. The core dataset contains <span class="Number">50,000</span> labeled, as well as unlabeled documents for unsupervised learning. In the entire collection, no more than 30 reviews are allowed for any given movie because reviews for the same movie tend to have correlated ratings. We used unlabeled data, as we are not interested in already provided sentiments, but want to calculate sentiments on ourselves. User reviews are keyed by IMDB ids rather than primary keys in the SQL database, hence we need to map each IMDB id to the corresponding primary key to be able to compare sentiments with other attributes like gross, release year, and more. As there is no information on IMDB ids in the database itself, we parsed OMDB website to find those.</p>
			
			<h3><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" href="#omdb" id="omdb"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>OMDB</h3>
			<p>The OMDb API is a free web service to obtain movie information. We have obtained <span class="Number">60,000</span> JSON documents from <a href="https://www.omdbapi.com">https://www.omdbapi.com</a>. Each JSON document contains following fields.</p>

			<p><em>Hint: Many collections having string values are encoded with integers to save some space, so we introduce collections ending by "_map" to get the initial strings values. Don't be scared if you see something like that, it's actually pretty awesome!</em></p>

			<h3>Statistics</h3>
			<p>The main discoveries in this part of solution refer entirely to the <strong>science fiction</strong> genre. The statistics are based on data provided by IMDB. For details see the particular section in Explainer Notebook.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="Number">172,650</span> actors played in <span class="Number">13,989</span> movies.</li>
				<li>The biggest cast has movie <strong>Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie (2014)</strong> with <span class="Number">448</span> actors. Here, IMDB lists all the normally uncredited extras in the cast.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><img alt="Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie (2014)" src="images/angry.jpg"></p>
			<ul><li>Actor <strong>Kōichi Yamadera (1961)</strong> played in <span class="Number">48</span> science fiction films.</li></ul>
			<p><img alt="Kōichi Yamadera (1961)" src="images/Yamadera.png"></p>
			<ul>
				<li>An actor acts in only <span class="Number">1.2</span> movies on average, and vice versa.</li>
				<li><span class="Number">82%</span> of movies and actors are connected, meaning if you get friends with an well-known actor, through a chain of actor-to-actor relationships you may become friends with <span class="Number">82%</span> of all actors on the planet.</li>
				<li>Probability that a particular actor plays in a particular movie is <span class="Number">0.0014%</span></li>
				<li>Probability that an actor plays in two random movies is <span class="Number">0.13%</span></li>
				<li>Probability that a movie hires two random actors is <span class="Number">0.034%</span></li>
				<li>An actor knows <span class="Number">59</span> actors on average.</li>
				<li><strong>Stan Lee (1922)</strong> knows <span class="Number">3,052</span> actors in total.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><img alt="Stan Lee (1922)" src="images/stanlee.jpg"></p>
			<ul>
				<li>A movie is connected through an actor to <span class="Number">18</span> movies on average.</li>
				<li>Two random actors (or movies) are reached in a maximum of <span class="Number">14</span> steps.</li>
				<li>Degrees of co-stardom network follow the power law distribution, meaning the most common number of movies an actor plays is <span class="Number">1</span>, while the most common number of actors a movie hires is <span class="Number">2</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p><iframe height="300px" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plot.ly/~polakowo/1.embed?share_key=kpWfHA77vruWsAH1txeIpI"></iframe></p>
			<ul><li>Friendship paradox is true: the most actors know fewer actors than those know on average.</li></ul>
			
			<h3>Centrality</h3>
			<blockquote>
				<p>In graph theory and network analysis, indicators of centrality identify the most important vertices within a graph</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>We are going to explore the most central nodes according to a few different centrality definitions.</p>
			<p><strong>Betweenness and closeness centrality</strong></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Betweenness centrality quantifies the number of times a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path between two other nodes. Closeness centrality measures the mean distance from a node to other nodes.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<ul><li>If you want to get friends with the most actors on Earth, first become friends with the cast of <strong>Iron Man Three (2013)</strong>, <strong>Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011)</strong>, or <strong>Captain America: Civil War (2016)</strong> as they are the most central hubs in the co-stardom network of science fiction movies.</li></ul>
			<p>
				<img alt="Iron Man Three (2013)" src="images/ironman3.jpg">
				<img alt="Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011)" src="images/transformers.jpg">
				<img alt="Captain America: Civil War (2016)" src="images/captainamerica.jpg">
			</p>
			<p><strong>Degree centrality</strong></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Degree centrality is the most basic method of defining centrality, basing the centrality only on the number of neighbours a node has.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<ul><li>Actors who played in <strong>Kaze no tani no Naushika (1984)</strong> played also in <span class="Number">343</span> different movies, which is a record.</li></ul>
			<p><img alt="Kaze no tani no Naushika (1984)" src="images/kaze.jpg"></p>
			<p><strong>Eigenvector centrality</strong></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>The eigenvector centrality thesis reads: A node is important if it is linked to by other important nodes.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<ul><li>Actors who played in <strong>Kidô senshi Gandamu (1981)</strong> played also in very connected movies like <strong>Kaze no tani no Naushika (1984)</strong></li></ul>
			<p><img alt="Kidô senshi Gandamu (1981)" src="images/gundam.jpg"></p>
			
			<h3>Attributes</h3>
			<p>Now we move on to observe different attributes (those of movies as well as those of actors). This step of analysis helps us to uncover the real structure of the network and how it has grown. We will check the assortativity of nodes in respect to attributes, but also answer whether attributes build good communities across the network.</p>
			<ul><li>The science fiction genre has experienced the main gain in popularity in the beginning of <span class="Number">2000th</span>, when the technology for movie production evolutionized, and it goes through the peak right now.</li></ul>
			<p><iframe height="300px" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plot.ly/~polakowo/4.embed"></iframe></p>
			<ul><li>The most common runtimes are around <span class="Number">10-30</span> min and <span class="Number">80-120</span> min.</li></ul>
			<p><iframe height="300px" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plot.ly/~polakowo/6.embed"></iframe></p>
			<ul><li>The most movies are low-budget movies. The more budget the movie has, the more money it spends on cast and crew, and the more profitable actors it hires, which also play in many other pictures.</li></ul>
			<p><iframe height="300px" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plot.ly/~polakowo/10.embed"></iframe></p>
			<ul><li>There more a movie invests, the more it becomes in return.</li></ul>
			<p><iframe height="300px" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plot.ly/~polakowo/14.embed"></iframe></p>
			<ul><li>The most actors of sci-fi films were born from <span class="Number">1950</span> to <span class="Number">1980</span>. Actors who were born in later years are younger and therefore less wanted as more experienced actors. We also see a trend that the science fiction becomes more and more popular and many new actors join this trend.</li></ul>
			<p><iframe height="300px" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plot.ly/~polakowo/16.embed"></iframe></p>
			<ul><li>Height attribute, in contrast, follows the normal (Gaussian) distribution, and isn't correlated with any other attribute.</li></ul>
			<p><iframe height="300px" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plot.ly/~polakowo/18.embed"></iframe></p>
			
			<h3>Assortativity</h3>
			<blockquote>
			<p>Assortative mixing is a preference for a network's nodes to attach to others that are similar in some way. The more is the coefficient of assortativity towards an attribute, the more the nodes prefer to attach to other nodes having a similar attribute value.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>By knowing assortativity we can closely approximate the behavior of the network.</p>

			<p><em>Hint: Numeric attributes like release year may have a very wide scale of values, which makes performance ugly.

The modularity hasn't suffered.</em></p>
			<ul><li>Production countries, release years, and languages are not good communities, that is for example, movies made within USA are interconnected only moderately, while they share many connections with movies made outside of USA. Film industry is an international industry.</li></ul>
